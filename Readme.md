# Kubernetes Learning Journey


This repository contains my personal Kubernetes learning journey.  
Each topic is organized in a separate folder so anyone can learn step-by-step just by following the lessons in sequence.  

## 📂 Folder Structure  

```
lesson1/
lesson2/
lesson3/

```



Each folder represents one dedicated **lesson**.

## 📘 What’s inside each lesson?  

Every lesson contains:

- Step-by-step explanation  
- Notes and commands  
- What I learned  
- Practical exercises  
- A **homework** section at the end  

This makes it super easy to follow along even if you’re a beginner starting with Kubernetes.

## 📄 When is a lesson considered completed?

A lesson is considered **complete** **ONLY IF** the folder includes a `README.md`.

➡️ If a lesson does **not** contain a `README.md`, that means the lesson is still in progress.

## 🧠 Why I’m doing this  

Many engineers find Kubernetes intimidating.  
This repo is my journey to break it down piece-by-piece and make it beginner-friendly.
